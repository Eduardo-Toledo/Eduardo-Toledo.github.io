## 1. Introduction
Puzzler aplication is a simple VR mobile that shows the complete process of design and implmenmtation of a VR from early stages.

## 2. Audience
The target is any tech lover  who wants to be embeded in this fascinating world of VR

## 3. Objectives
- For VR lovers, start a VR project from scratch
- Focus on the iterative process of any cycle of life of any VR project.
- User feedback is as important as good practices of development.

## 4. Deliverables
- Mobile app that is visualized through Google Cardboard
- Game mechanism is based on the popular game "Simon says".
- Documentation about all entire process carried out from early stages until final solution.

## 5. Profiles of my testing users

- User 1: My wife of almost 35 years old (Adult)
- User 2: My daughte of 7 years old(Kids).


## 6. Story of Iterative Process
By  doing a work breakdow,  the process was made up by:

```markdown
- Atmosphere design  One iteration into the process to achive the final result.
- User Interface Sketches.
- User Inteface Implementation.
- Motion Implementation.
- Final App: Game mechanish plus Audio.
```

### 6.1. Atmosphere Design
The idea is to create a mistery atmosphere thorugh a semi-dark and abandoned room.

#### 6.1.1. Atmosphere Design - Iteration Number 1

#### 6.1.2. Atmosphere Design - Results of User Testing (Feedback) on Iteration 1

##### User 1
- Scale and Space is appropiate
- Lightning offers a atmposphere of mystery
- The light of tor should be with less bright
- The light of orbs should be more bright

##### User 2:

Scale and Space is appropiate
There is a mistery atmosphere
The camera is a bit far of the orbs

#### 6.1.3. Atmosphere Design - Final Result after changes proposed by Testing Users

### 6.2. User Interface (UI) Sketches
At the beginning of the game, the app offers a welcome screen and invites to play by hitting Play button. Once the game finishes , the app informs to the player through a congratulations screen that he/she won.
