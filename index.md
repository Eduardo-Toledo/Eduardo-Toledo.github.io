## 4. Deliverables
- Mobile app that is visualized through Google Cardboard
- Game mechanism is based on the popular game "Simon says".

## 5. Profiles of my testing users

- User 1: My wife of almost 35 years old.

## 6. Story of Iterative Process
By  doing a work breakdow,  the process was made up by:

```markdown
- Atmosphere design  One iteration into the process to achive the final result.
- User Interface Sketches.
- Motion Implementation.
- Final App: Game mechanish plus Audio.
```

### 6.1. Atmosphere Design
The idea is to create a mistery atmosphere thorugh a semi-dark and abandoned room.
